### This is Jarrod
Jarrod is an incredibly determined, charismatic individual who happens to suffer from Multiple Sclerosis(MS). The damage it has done to his body has been so profound it renders him unable to use any form of off-the-shelf technology to communicate independently. He suffers from quadriplegia, blindness, and cannot speak clearly enough to use speech-to-text converters.

### This is Miro  
Miro is a flexible program our team is developing for our capstone engineering project, which will hopefully be useful for Jarrod and many other people with extensive and unique disabilities. Miro allows multiple inputs and outputs to be seamlessly connected to maximize the number of signals available for communication.   
More details and tutorials will be coming in April 2017, for now please contact max.prokopenko _at_ gmail.com with any questions.
